```

## Deployment

### Docker Images

All services are containerized with optimized multi-stage builds:

1. **Base Rust Image**: For compilation.
2. **Slim Runtime Image**: Minimal footprint for production.
3. **Minimal Dependencies**: Only necessary libraries included.
4. **Resource Limits**: Defined in Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifests.

**Example Dockerfile**:
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM rust:latest AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN cargo build --release

# Stage 2: Runtime
FROM debian:buster-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=builder /app/target/release/service-name .
CMD ["./service-name"]
```

### Kubernetes Configuration

- **Resource Quotas**: Define CPU and memory limits.
- **GPU Allocation**: Specify NVIDIA GPU resources for services requiring them.
- **Health Probes**: Liveness and readiness probes for each service.
- **Auto-scaling Policies**: Horizontal Pod Autoscalers based on CPU or custom metrics.
- **Ingress Configuration**: Manage external access to services.

**Example Deployment Manifest**:
```yaml

### Helm Charts

Using Helm for managing Kubernetes applications:

   helm install ai-services ./helm/ai-services
   ```

## Security

Ensuring the security of your services is paramount. This platform incorporates multiple security measures:

- **JWT Authentication**: Secure API access with JSON Web Tokens.
- **Rate Limiting**: Prevent abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.
- **Input Validation**: Sanitize and validate all incoming data to prevent injections and other attacks.
- **Error Handling**: Avoid exposing sensitive information through error messages.
- **Secure Logging**: Ensure logs do not contain sensitive data and are stored securely.
- **TLS Encryption**: Encrypt data in transit using HTTPS.

**Best Practices**:

- Regularly update dependencies to patch vulnerabilities.
- Implement role-based access control (RBAC) in Kubernetes.
- Use network policies to restrict inter-service communication as needed.
- Store secrets securely using Kubernetes Secrets or external secret managers like HashiCorp Vault.

## Monitoring

Effective monitoring ensures the reliability and performance of your services:

- **Prometheus Metrics**: Collect and store metrics for analysis.
- **Health Endpoints**: Each service exposes `/health` for Kubernetes probes.
- **Resource Usage Tracking**: Monitor CPU, memory, and GPU usage.
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track response times and throughput.

**Tools & Integration**:

- **Grafana**: Visualize metrics and create dashboards.
- **Alertmanager**: Set up alerts for critical metrics and incidents.
- **ELK Stack**: For advanced logging and log analysis.
- **Kube-state-metrics**: Monitor Kubernetes cluster state.
- **Jaeger**: Distributed tracing for microservices.

**Prometheus Configuration Example**:
```yaml
global:
  scrape_interval: 15s

scrape_configs:
  - job_name: 'kubernetes-services'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: endpoints
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_service_label_app]
        action: keep
        regex: ai-.*

  - job_name: 'kubernetes-pods'
    kubernetes_sd_configs:
      - role: pod
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_scrape]
        action: keep
        regex: true
      - source_labels: [__meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_path]
        target_label: __metrics_path__
        regex: (.+)
      - source_labels: [__address__, __meta_kubernetes_pod_annotation_prometheus_io_port]
        target_label: __address__
        regex: (.+):(?:\d+);(\d+)
        replacement: $1:$2
```

## Disaster Recovery

Preparedness for unexpected failures is crucial. This section outlines strategies and procedures to recover from disasters effectively.

### Backup Strategy

- **Data Backups**: Regularly back up all critical data, including databases and persistent volumes.
  - **Automated Backups**: Use Kubernetes CronJobs or external services to schedule backups.
  - **Storage Solutions**: Store backups in secure, geographically distributed locations (e.g., AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage).

- **Configuration Backups**: Maintain version-controlled backups of all configuration files, including Kubernetes manifests and environment variables.

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Identify the Failure**:
   - Use monitoring tools to detect and diagnose the issue.
   - Check logs and alerts to understand the scope and impact.

2. **Isolate the Problem**:
   - Prevent the issue from spreading to other services.
   - Scale down or disable affected components if necessary.

3. **Restore from Backups**:
   - **Data Restoration**: Restore databases and persistent storage from the latest backups.
   - **Configuration Restoration**: Reapply Kubernetes manifests and environment configurations.

4. **Redeploy Services**:
   - Use CI/CD pipelines to redeploy affected services.
   - Ensure that deployments are successful and services are running correctly.

5. **Validate Recovery**:
   - Perform health checks and run tests to confirm that services are operational.
   - Monitor performance to ensure normal operation.

6. **Post-Mortem Analysis**:
   - Document the incident, its impact, and the recovery steps taken.
   - Identify root causes and implement measures to prevent future occurrences.

### High Availability

- **Redundancy**: Deploy multiple instances of each service to prevent single points of failure.
- **Geographical Distribution**: Spread services across different regions or availability zones.
- **Auto-Scaling**: Automatically adjust the number of running instances based on demand and health.

### Failover Mechanisms

- **Load Balancing**: Distribute traffic evenly across healthy instances.
- **Backup Services**: Have standby services ready to take over in case of primary service failure.
- **DNS Failover**: Redirect traffic to healthy regions or data centers if one becomes unavailable.

### Testing Disaster Recovery

- **Regular Drills**: Simulate disasters to test recovery procedures and team readiness.
- **Automated Testing**: Incorporate disaster recovery tests into CI/CD pipelines.
- **Documentation**: Keep recovery procedures up-to-date and accessible to all team members.
